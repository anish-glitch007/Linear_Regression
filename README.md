# Linear_Regression

1.   a) Can you perform a simple linear regression (from scratch) analysis to determine if there is a relationship between the phone's  pixel density and its rating using line search approach?
      b) What is the slope and intercept of the regression line, and what is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for this model?
      c) Plot Cost function (both as surface as well as contour) and best fit line.
   
2. a) How about multiple linear regression (from scratch) analysis? Can you predict the phone's rating based on its pixel density, screen size, weight, RAM, processor frequency, screen-to-body ratio, height, internal memory, capacity, and resolution using 80-20 train-test split ratio? (Using gradient descent approach). 
b) What is the MSE for this model? Also explore R-squared (R2) error.

3. a) Can you visualise the relationship between the phone's rating and each of its features using scatter plots (Individual scatter plot for each feature)?
b)  Which features have a strong linear relationship with the rating, and which features appear to have little or no impact on the rating?
